Hi everyone, I'm Egor. This little blog is a dedicated place for 

 - a) me not to forget code/knowledge snippets  
 - b) share them with others.


Technology-wise, this website is made with [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio), and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Below you may find more elaborate info about different aspects of me.
