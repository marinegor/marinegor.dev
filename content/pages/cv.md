## Profile

I have formal education in applied mathematics and physics (BSc + MSc), one year of full-time extracurricular education in computer science, PhD in biophysics and structural biology, and 8 years of computational lab experience.

I enjoy writing code and building complex systems, and want to do that for the things that get to run many times, and hence should be designed and written wisely. I know a lot about (computational) biology, mostly on molecular level (structural biology, protein biochemistry). And I can communicate with people, including mentoring or leading small teams, at least that's what I have had experience with so far.

## Career
I have been roughly 8 years in science, working with membrane proteins and their structure-function relationships: GPCRs, (microbal) rhodopsins, membrane transporters, P450 enzymes, antibodies and nanobodies.

I am currently employed at ENPICOM B.V., and before that have worked at the University of Groningen and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Also, I have worked at many synchrotrons and XFELs, and also was a visiting research assistant at the University of Southern California.

ü§ì [MDAnalysis Core Developer](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/team/) since February 2025. For MDAnalysis, wrote a [parallel backend](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/pull/4162) for all analysis classes (dask/multiprocessing), added a [DSSP module](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/pull/4304) for native secondary structure assignment, currently working on an [MMCIF parser](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/pull/4712).

üßë‚Äçüíª contributed to opensource: [reciprocalspaceship](https://github.com/rs-station/reciprocalspaceship): wrote parser for serial crystallography data into binary dataframe-like class, [ntfy-cryosparc](https://github.com/marinegor/ntfy_cryosparc/): wrote web-server to parse CryoSPARC (tm) notifications and notify appropriate users.

üòé participated in Google Summer of Code contributing to [MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/): introduced process-based parallelization to the library using `dask` or `multiprocessing` (see main [PR](https://github.com/marinegor/mdanalysis/tree/feature/dask-0)).

üèÜ participated in data science competitions (top-10% in Kaggle "Predict Molecular Properties", top-1 in first round of "Learning How To Smell", top-10% in Takeda Signate competition, 5th place in Tochka Bank graph ML competition).

üíæ administrated ~15 Linux workstations and servers with around 40 users, managing around 200 Tb of research data.

üçù performed large-scale calculations on SLURM and PBS, wrote  bash scripts and pipelines or reliable and reproducible data processing of serial crystallography data.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è self-hosted bunch of things: *arr, telegram bots, WebDAV, proxy & VPN servers, paperless, openwebui, you name it

ü¶Ä Wrote a python(pyo3)+Rust(pest) parser for crystallographic data, contributed to [polars-distance](https://github.com/ion-elgreco/polars-distance)
