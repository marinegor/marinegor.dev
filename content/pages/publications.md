However, if you want some personal insights about selected papers (in reverse chronological order) -- please read alongðŸ˜Ž

# 2024

## [A subgroup of light-driven sodium pumps with an additional Schiff base counterion](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47469-0)

A project led by super talented [Kirill Kovalev](https://twitter.com/kirkovalev94). Whereas it's always a pleasure to work with Kirill, it's also a great study that combines multiple techniques, both functional and structural, to study a novel rhodopsin. For me personally, it's a first paper that confirms I can do cryoEM data processingðŸ¥¶

## [On the methods of studying protein-ligand interaction dynamics](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/on-the-methods-of-studying-protein-ligand-interaction-dynamics)

My thesis, written under supervision of Albert Guskov, Valentin Borshchevskiy and Dirk Slotboom. The text is open access, and is basically composed of few articles mentioned below, plus some extra nice acknowledgements in multiple languages.

# 2023

## [Regression-Based Active Learning for Accessible Acceleration of Ultra-Large Library Docking](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01661)

Amazing (conflict of interest: I am the last author) paper, where we basically show that deep learning isn't needed for accelerated virtual screening.

For more info, please go to the article [description]({{< ref "/posts/accelerated-virtual-screening" >}})


## [Custom Design of a Humidifier Chamber for In Meso Crystallization](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.cgd.3c01034)

A neat paper that shares an open-source design (as in "to assemble on your own if you have decent skills") of a humidifier chamber for a Gryphon crystallization robot, that unfortunately doesn't have such chamber.

## [Structural insights into the effects of glycerol on ligand binding to cytochrome P450](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798322011019)

Neat piece of evidence showing that glycerol (a common cryoprotectant in crystallography) can significantly effect the binding pose, constrain it, and make the conformational ensemble of protein-ligand compless less rich.

# 2022

## [Structural basis for receptor selectivity and inverse agonism in S1P5 receptors](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32447-1)

Super cool paper, many challenging tasks -- patent parsing, docking, serial crystallography, computer vision, etc. For more detail, please read the article [description]({{< ref "/posts/s1p5-paper" >}}).

# 2021

## [Structural aspects of photopharmacology: insight into the binding of photoswitchable and photocaged inhibitors to the glutamate transporter homologue](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c11336)

Photo. Switchable. Ligands. A prospect towards time-resolved studies and other things. Not by me though, I only did docking to confirm relatively unclear binding poses revealed by crystallography.

# 2020

## [Structure-Based Virtual Screening of Ultra-Large Library Yields Potent Antagonists for a Lipid GPCR](https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10121634)

Large-scale VLS that didn't work as good as we hoped, but gave (at least me) a good perspective on such studies.

## [Small-wedge synchrotron and serial XFEL datasets for Cysteinyl leukotriene GPCRs](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00729-2)

Huge dataset with serial crystallography data across wide range of resolutions and techniques.

## [Molecular mechanism of light-driven sodium pumping](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16032-y)

Very cool study that shows a serial crystallography (with a jet!) dataset collected at ALBA synchrotron. The structure itself reveals a "trapped" state of KR2 rhodopsin.

# 2019

## [Structural basis of ligand selectivity and disease mutations in cysteinyl leukotriene receptors](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13348-2)

CysLT2 paper, with lots of docking and crystallography.

## [Structure-based mechanism of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor inhibition by antiasthmatic drugs](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aax2518)

CysLT1 paper, with lots of molecular dynamics, functional tests, and hopes.

# 2017

## [Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan8862)

Very long awaited publication, which was also a very random co-authorship for me, though I'm very grateful for that.

## [Element-specific density profiles in interacting biomembrane models](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/aa59d3)

My very first publication, written during DESY Summerschool program. I validated someone else's data processing, and got the same results, confirming that it's a solid data processing pipeline.
